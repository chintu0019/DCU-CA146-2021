There is no unique output for this task, it depends upon the
characters from the pages which your implementation chooses
to use.

Therefore, here, the test runs your encoder, and then runs
a known-correct decoder to verify that your encoder is correct.

You will only see the output of your encoder if it is incorrect.

Decoded:
  Mary had a little lamb its fleece was white as snow,
  And everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go.
