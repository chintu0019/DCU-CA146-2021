# Each assignment, above, reads in a new number and adds it to the existing
# total. We do that ten times.

# An alternative would be to begin by reading in ten numbers, and then add
# them up.
#
# However, in my opinion (SB), the approach is above is clearer.  (It's also
# easier to write because we can just use cut and paste.)
