    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
