    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,

    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
