   |I cannot tell what sentiment ******* the quite solitary churchyard, with
   |*** inscribed headstone; *** gate, *** two trees, *** low horizon,
   |girdled by a broken wall, and *** newly-risen crescent, attesting the
   |hour of eventide.
   |
   |The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
   |
   |The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
   |quickly: it was an object of terror.
   |
   |So was the ***** ****** thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
   |crowd surrounding a gallows.
   |
   |Each ******* told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
   |understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
   |interesting as the tales ****** sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
   |when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
   |ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
   |while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
   |borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
   |taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
   |discovered) from the pages of ******* and ****** Earl of Moreland.
