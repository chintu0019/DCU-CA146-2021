    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
end
