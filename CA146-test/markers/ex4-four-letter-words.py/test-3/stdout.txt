We all **** out to Montreux
On the **** Geneva shoreline
To **** records **** a mobile
We didn't **** **** ****
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
**** at the **** place around
But **** stupid **** a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, **** in the sky
Smoke on the water
**** burned **** the gambling house
It **** **** an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling **** out the ground
**** it all was ****
We had to **** another place
But Swiss **** was running out
It seemed **** we would **** the ****
Smoke on the water, **** in the sky
Smoke on the water
We ended up at the Grand hotel
It was empty **** and ****
But **** the Rolling truck Stones thing **** outside
Making our music there
**** a few red lights and a few old ****
We **** a place to sweat
No matter **** we get out of ****
I **** we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, **** in the sky
Smoke on the water
