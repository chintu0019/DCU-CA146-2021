In a statement, Activision Blizzard chief executive Bobby Kotick said:
"With a combined global network of more than half a billion monthly active
users, our potential to reach audiences around the world on the device of
their choosing enables us to deliver great games to even bigger audiences
than ever before."
Mr Kotick told the Reuters news agency that the company wanted to broaden
its reach and appeal to a larger demographic.
He said that 60% of King Digital Entertainment's players were female, and
that no games console or hardware, besides a smartphone, was needed to
access its games.
