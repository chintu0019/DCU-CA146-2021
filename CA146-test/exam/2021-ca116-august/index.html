  <!-- This is the link for the exam.  It's not exactly secure like this.  But the alternative would be to
    put it on the server somewehere.  That would require the link to be configured for each module, and
    require some server-side Javascript.  So I'd prefer to keep it simple.

    Put your own "href" below.
