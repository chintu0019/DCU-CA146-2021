****
Today's lab task are _too easy_ if you can simply copy the code from the slides.

Given a description of the algorithm (and its steps), you should be able to
put together your own implementation.  It is (almost) never correct to be
copying Python code verbatim.

This placeholder will be replaced with the selection-sort slides in due course.
