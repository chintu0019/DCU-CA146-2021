****
There will be three "lab exams":

- one in week four,
- one in week seven, and
- one in week ten

Each lab exam will take place at 16:00 in that week's Wednesday-afternoon
slot and last for 90 minutes.
****

****
Here are some details:

- These will be open-book assessments, and will involve you completing a small number of computer programming tasks.
- The exam tasks will be available on the course web site: http://ca116.computing.dcu.ie/[].
- You will be uploading your solutions to _Einstein_: http://ca116.computing.dcu.ie/einstein/[].

- Be aware that there may be brief periods during the days and hours
  leading up to the lab exam during which the regular course web site is
  not available
****

.Rules
****
- This is an examination; examination rules apply: +
  communication between classmates (or anybody else) is strictly forbidden.
- In your solutions to the tasks you are given, you **may not** use Python
  features which have not been covered in the module.
****

.What to expect
****
- You will be asked to complete a small number of tasks.  The type and scope of
  the tasks will be similar to those on the regular lab sheets, and the tasks will vary in difficulty.
- There will be fewer tasks than on a typical lab sheet.
- The examinable material is everything that has been covered in the
  module, excluding material covered for the first time in the week of the exam.
****

.Marking
****
- The marking process is primarily automatic.  You will upload your work in
  the usual way and correct solutions will (initially) receive full marks (for the
  task) and incorrect solutions zero marks.
- In addition, all solutions will be briefly reviewed for style and
  approach.  For example, marks will be deducted for poor solutions, or for
  solutions which use inappropriate techniques.
- It will not be possible to provide detailed feedback to all students.
