* ****************************************************************
= Part 1 -- Workflow

- basics (cd, nano, python3, einstein)

- common mistakes:
  * stuck in REPL
  * case sensitivity
  * entering password for einstein command
  * Python error messages:
    ** syntax error
    ** name error
    ** EOF
    ** others?

* ****************************************************************
= Part 2 -- Review of week 1 work

- variables (see slides)

* ****************************************************************
= Part 3 -- Examples from week 1

- focus:
  * getting started writing, running and uploading scripts
  * working with integer division and modulus

- examples:
 * the-three-digits.py
 * odd-value-or-zero.py

* ****************************************************************
= Part 4 -- The Boolean type

- comparison operators
- Boolean operators

- examples:
  * standard input consists of a single number, a day of the week (where
    Monday is represented by 1, Tuesday by 2, and so on

    write a Python script is-weekend-1.py which outputs True if the day is
    a weekend day, and False otherwise

  * standard input consists of a single integer, a year (e.g. 2021)

    write a Python script named is-leap-year-1.py which out puts True if
    the year is a leap year, and False otherwise

* ****************************************************************
= Part 5 -- Strings and floating-point numbers

- strings
  * literals
  * string comparison
  * len()

- floating-point numbers

* ****************************************************************
= Part 6 -- If statements

- syntax
  * if
  * if-else

- examples:
  * is-weekend-2.py (same as above, except write the message "weekend" or
    "weekday")
  * is-leap-year-2.py (same as above, except write the message "leap year"
    or "normal year" as appropriate)

- syntax
  * if-elif-else
  * example:
    standard input consists of a single integer representing a day of the
    week as before.

    write a python script name "day-of-the-week.py" which outputs the name
    of the corresponding day of the week (e.g. "Monday")
